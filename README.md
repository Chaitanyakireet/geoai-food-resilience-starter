# GeoAI Food-Resilience Digital Twin

Starter repository for the 48-hour Hyderabad–Telangana project.

## Non-negotiable project locks
- Proper web platform, not a mobile app.
- Hyderabad–Telangana regional food system.
- Multi-food / food-agnostic; never narrow to rice-only.
- SDG 2 primary; SDGs 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17 secondary.
- GIS / spatial intelligence is central to the product experience.
- Core loop: Sense → Predict → Diagnose/Trace → Reason → Optimize → Simulate → Recover → Verify/Impact → Explain → Human Review.
- Numeric calculations are deterministic; the LLM explains/orchestrates and does not invent or override numbers.
- Truth status labels: OBSERVED, DERIVED, ESTIMATED, COUNTERFACTUAL, SIMULATED.

## Repository rule
Treat `docs/MASTER_HANDOFF.md` and the full DOCX as the project source of truth. Do not redesign or narrow the scope.

## Architecture decision (Hours 0-2 foundation task)
- `backend/` — Python 3.12 analytical/backend service (FastAPI). Owns GeoAI/GIS
  processing, risk engine, food-network graph, intervention logic, optimization,
  digital twin, recovery/impact, data/provenance, and all deterministic
  simulation logic. One service; do not split into microservices without a
  genuine need.
- `frontend/` — Node.js/TypeScript (Next.js). Owns the GIS/map UX, navigation,
  dashboards, intervention workflows, Compare Worlds, Digital Twin
  visualization, AI Copilot interface, truth-status display, evidence/
  provenance UI, and Responsible AI UI.
- `src/` and `web/` are superseded placeholders from the original scaffold,
  kept (not deleted) for history; see their READMEs.

## Running the backend
```
cd backend  # requirements.txt lives here; venv at repo root
..\.venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload --app-dir ..
```
Or from the repo root: `.venv\Scripts\python -m uvicorn backend.api.main:app --reload`.
Health check: `GET http://localhost:8000/health`.

## Running the frontend
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3000 — it fetches the backend `/health` endpoint and
shows a "Backend reachable" panel with the live locked config, or a red
"Backend unreachable" notice if the backend isn't running.

## Tests
```
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests\
```

## Current state
Hours 0-2 foundation only: both services boot, the frontend proves live
reachability to the backend, and a healthcheck smoke test exists. No
analytical modules (GeoAI, risk, graph, optimization, twin, RAG, copilot) are
implemented yet — they follow the build order in `docs/MASTER_HANDOFF.md`
section 19. Nothing here is fabricated; `/health` only reflects the committed
`config/project.yaml`.
